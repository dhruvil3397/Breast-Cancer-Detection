# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Worldwide, breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women and the second highest in terms of mortality rates.Diagnosis of breast cancer is performed when an abnormal lump is found (from self-examination or x-ray) or a tiny speck of calcium is seen (on an x-ray). After a suspicious lump is found, the doctor will conduct a diagnosis to determine whether it is cancerous and, if so, whether it has spread to other parts of the body. This breast cancer dataset was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg.

The machine learning algorithm predict whether the patient has breast cancer in benign or malignant stage.
